# Meruem

####What is Meruem?

Short Answer: Meruem is a [Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29) dialect. 

Long Answer: Meruem is a dynamically typed interpreted programming language that supports both functional programming (lambdas, closures, higher-order functions, etc) and meta-programming (Lisp macros and quasiquotes). 

####Interpreter
The interpreter, written in the Scala programming langugae, runs on the Java Virtual Machine.

####REPL
Like most (if not all) of the Lisps out there, Meruem has a REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) on which you can easily evaluate expressions and get their results immediately.
