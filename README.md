# Meruem

####What is Meruem?

Short Answer: Meruem is a [Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29) dialect. 

Long Answer: Meruem is a dynamically typed interpreted programming language that supports both functional programming (lambdas, closures, higher-order functions, etc) and meta-programming (Lisp macros and quasiquotes). 

####Interpreter and Standard Modules
The [interpreter](https://github.com/melvic-ybanez/Meruem/tree/master/src/main/scala), written in the Scala programming langugae, runs on the Java Virtual Machine ([view the code](https://github.com/melvic-ybanez/Meruem/tree/master/src/main/scala)). The standard library is written in Meruem and can be found [here](https://github.com/melvic-ybanez/Meruem/tree/master/meruem).

####REPL
Like most (if not all) of the Lisps out there, Meruem has a REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) on which you can easily evaluate expressions and get their results immediately.
